# dijkstra-vba-excel
Implementation of DijkstraÂ´s Algorithm and Creation of Quasi-Random Paths in VBA
used first for the generation of defined graphs for training data for machine learning applied to routing problems
by default, 20 000 graphs are created
parametrization can be done in terms of:
  number of nodes per graph
  numer of neighboring nodes per node (number of edges per node)
  minmum/maximum weight per edge
  ...
